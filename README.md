# Pony's Godly Overhaul

Overhauls the Gods' keepsakes, transferring their functionality to an altar and giving each keepsake a unique effect.

## Installation

Follow instructions on Hell 2 Modding's readme.

## Usage

This mod transfers the functionality of all Gods of Olympus' keepsakes, guaranteeing their appearance and letting you rarify their boons, to a separate altar. You can pick a god in this altar, getting the same effect as if you'd picked their keepsake. With their keepsakes now useless, all Gods of Olympus' keepsakes have been given unique effects.

### The Altar

You can find the altar in your training room next to the pitch black stone, and you also access it by closing the keepsake rack.

Interact with the altar or close the keepsake rack to open the menu, showing you all available gods. A god becomes available when you give them nectar and obtain their keepsake. The text display at the bottom shows which god you have currently selected. Click on a god's image to select them, click them again to deselect them. Leveling a god's keepsake increases the rarify level if applicable.
